# Starter + Battery/Avionics + Lights 3x Panel Set

The panels are recognized as a joystick, no extra software needed.  
Separete "classic" turnkey position virtual buttons can be used with older airplane models if needed.  
Please use USB A-C cable if the device is not recognized via C-C connection.  

## Starter Panel  
* 3 "regular" buttons : 1..3  
* 3 "inverse" buttons : 4..6 - required for XPlane only  
* 4 virtual Turnkey position buttons : 7..10 (Off-R-L-Both)  

## Alternator/Battery/Avionics  
* 4 "regular" buttons 1..4  
* 4 "inverse" buttons - required for XPlane only  

## Lights Panel  
* 5 "regular" buttons  
* 5 "inverse" buttons for XPlane only  


## X-Plane setup  

A pre-configured X-Plane 11/12 joystick configuration file is provided  
X-Plane setup:  

1. Disconnect the device if previously connected  
2. Close X-Plane if it is running  
3. Copy the supplied *.joy and *.png files into the <X-Plane_root>\Resourses\Joystick configs\ folder  
4. Start X-Plane  
5. Connect the panel(s) via USB  

After these steps, a new device will be available in the "Joysticks" section with pre-configured buttons  

The regular and inverse buttons are mutually exclusive.  
Such setup allows using "_on" and "_off" commands in X-Plane to ensure correct operation.  

## MSFS Setup - TODO  

** Please ping me if you need help configuring it

(TODO) Suggested MSFS joystick configuration will be provided via screenshot.  

Unfortunately, MSFS doesn't behave consistently across different airplanes.  
Some fiddling might be required to get all the buttons working as expected - depending on your setup.
