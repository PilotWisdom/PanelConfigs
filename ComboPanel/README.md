# Starter + Avionics + Lights Combo panel  

The panel is recognized as a joystick, no extra software needed.
To allow both X-Plane and MSFS configuration, the virtual joystick has 
* 12 "regular" buttons : 1..12  
* 12 "reverse" buttons : 13..24  
* 4 Turnkey position buttons : 25..28 (Off-R-L-Both)  

The regular and reverse buttons are mutually exclusive.  
Such setup allows using "_on" and "_off" commands in X-Plane to ensure correct operation.
The separete "classic" turnkey position buttons can be used with older airplanes with start key.

## X-Plane setup  

A pre-configured X-Plane 11/12 joystick configuration file is provided  
X-Plane setup:  

1. Disconnect the device if previously connected  
2. Close X-Plane if it is running  
3. Copy the supplied *.joy and *.png files into the <X-Plane_root>\Resourses\Joystick configs\ folder  
4. Start X-Plane  
5. Connect the panel via USB  

After these steps, a new device will be available in the "Joysticks" section with pre-configured buttons

## MSFS Setup

Suggested MSFS joystick configuration is provided via screenshot.  
Only first 12 buttons need to be configured, you can leave the other 12 unassigned.  

Unfortunately, MSFS doesn't behave consistently across different airplanes.  
Some fiddling might be required to get all the buttons working as expected - depending on your setup.
